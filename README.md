WebVR Graffitti


Wev VR Graffitti painter application which works with HTC Vive and/or Razer Hydra

To use the Razer Hydra you will need to run [this](https://github.com/yomboprime/hydrajoy) little C native app which while running it creates a virtual gamepad accessible from the browser. Only GNU/Linux version (perhaps it can be built for Mac, if you can look into it)

## User input

### Razer Hydra:

Press the trigger to paint, press button 1 to show/hide the menu.

### HTC Vive:

Press first button to paint, second button to show/hide the menu.
The analog trigger doesn't work for Vive yet (seeking info about HTC Vive trigger and buttons mapping)

## Menu

In the menu you can select the Red, Green and Red color values, and erase the wall.
